# micca
Micca is a program designed by Andrew Mangogna (co-author of Models to Code) to aid in the translation of Executable UML (xUML) domain models into C code. The actual code is maintained outside of Github in a [Fossil repository](https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/wiki?name=MiccaPage). This Github repository is empty, but serves as a location for a wiki and discussion group and convenient set of references managed by Leon Starr.
