# micca
Micca is a program to aid in the translation of Executable UML (xUML) domain models into C code. The actual code is maintained outside of Github, but this repository serves as, not so much a mirror, but as a location for a wiki and discussion group and convenient set of references to the fossil repository where it is maintained.o
