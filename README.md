# micca
Micca is a program designed by Andrew Mangogna, co-author of the book [Models to Code](https://modelstocode.com), to aid in the translation of Executable UML (xUML) domain models into C code.

The actual code is maintained outside of Github by Model Realization in a [Fossil repository](https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/wiki?name=MiccaPage).

This Github repository is empty, but serves as a location for a wiki and discussion group and convenient set of references managed by Leon Starr in hopes of introducing this outstanding set of tools to a wider community.
